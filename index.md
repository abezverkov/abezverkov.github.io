### Coding since I was knee high to a grasshopper. 

I have been coding since I was a kid.  From the moment I realized I could type magic words into a box and make it obey my every command, I have been entranced.  I started at just eight years old with Apple Basic and quickly moved on to whatever language I had available.  I self-taught Borland C++ when I was twelve, and like any twelve-year-old with an obsession it consumed my every waking moment, not always to my benefit.  I started building PCs, networks, and websites in high school for extra money on the side while fixing and selling computers for a local office supply chain.  All this to say, I have always been obsessed with computers.  They make sense to me.  

### [Automation](/automation) 

The one thing I think I like best about computers, and the reason I love programming, is that computers are *literally* logical machines, cranking away endlessly at tasks without tiring or opinion,  which makes then wonderful at automating away all the things we don’t want to do.  Whether its something simple and imperative in a CLI like DOS, Bash, or Powershell, or something more complex like C++ or C#, the ability to automate away tasks, is what drives the world.  

Who wouldn’t want that kind of ability?  To type some words on a keyboard, and never have to do that task again; to never have to remember how; to never have to worry about messing it up.  Long before CI/CD pipelines and DevOps, we had schedulers and cron, BATCH and Bash.  Cleanups, reboots, diagnostics, builds, and deploys could all be done automatically with a clever enough script, even if you had to reverse engineer systems with little to no documentation.  The tools have only become more and more advanced as time goes on, and will continue to do so each and every year.  ML is now watching, and informing us of events out of the ordinary, things that need attention, and processes that can be automated.  In the not so far off future, even the automation will be automated.

### Mission

My joy is helping/watching it all come to fruition.  Helping make really hard things effortless.

To do this, I have spent over twenty years learning.  Absorbing new technologies, new techniques, new patterns and thought processes, new languages, and new ways of bringing people together with the right solutions.  Solutions that are efficient, elegant, flexible, scalable, testable, and deliverable, but most importantly understandable by everyone involved.  There is no right answer.  The best answer is the answer that solves the problem, with the least cost (both physical and mental capital), and with the most acceptable downsides.
