Lead a globally diverse team of skilled contractors on a greenfield cloud-native e-commerce platform.

#### [Architecture](/architecture)
Lead design and development of online e-commerce platform grossing $2MM per month. Implementation included micro-service APIs hosted in Linux containers on Azure App Services for containers, APIM, Monitoring, CDN, and ETL. Refactored original POC software/data designs deliver a dynamically scalable and flexible platform to accelerate business objectives.  Lead third-party integration efforts of several disparate systems for both real-time import and export, including various payment processors, POS, mobile, and CRMs.

#### [Cloud](/cloud)
Designed and built cloud strategies. Implemented IaaS resources and networking for BI and Analytics, including VPN gateways and AAD/DS for security. Built monitoring dashboards and alerts for security and resource consumption as well as conducted weekly security, performance, and cost reviews.  Refactored initial PoC setup, reducing cost while increasing traffic throughput.  Worked with business units (ex: Marketing, Guest Loyalty) to implement automation and ETL (ex: Salesforce, Customer Surveys, Chatbots).

#### [Automation](/automation)
Created and maintained gated automation strategies for KANBAN development processes and continuous delivery across multiple environments including automated web front-end deployments with unit, integration, and regression testing against multiple browsers and CDN;  back-end micro-service deployments to containers with testing and infrastructure; DNS change deployments across hundreds of domains using  DnsControl from StackExchange; and application and infrastructure deployment environment creation scripting. This enabled us to test application changes along with infrastructure changes at lower levels; ensure all changes were in sync; deploy at will to production with confidence, and; spin up new production-like environments for testing specific scenarios.
